# Hypercane

Hypercane is a framework for building algorithms for sampling mementos from a web archive collection. Hypercane is the entry point of the [Dark and Stormy Archives (DSA) toolkit](https://oduwsdl.github.io/dsa/). A user can generate samples with Hypercane and then view those samples via the Web Archive Storytelling tool [Raintale](https://oduwsdl.github.io/raintale/), thus allowing the user to automatically summarize a web archive collection as a few small samples visualized as a social media story.

**This is a historical repository preserving the last work with Hypercane at Old Dominion University.**
